Hey there 👋🏻 I'm Riccardo. I'm a Cyber Security Manager. 

I help you build security into your products from the ground up 🌴

With over a decade of expertise in software engineering and cybersecurity, I help customers mitigate cybersecurity risks and strengthen their defenses throughout the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), enabling them to build products with the “just right” amount of security. 

As a strong advocate for Secure-by-Design principles, I ensure that even emerging technologies like Generative AI Systems are built with robust security foundations.

I also empower developers to create foundationally secure systems through comprehensive training programs. By helping them understand the importance of incorporating security at the core of their solutions, I enable companies to transform their approach to secure software development.

I am proud to contribute to OWASP projects, collaborating with the global community to enhance application security standards and practices. Together, we strive to create a safer digital landscape for all.
